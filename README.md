English-French list of cybersecurity terms

Do you need to improve your Québécois French cybersecurity vocabulary?  

There seems to be no one-stop resource available to easily find a list of basic cybersecurity terms in both English and French. Either the resources I found were only in one language, were too specific to one domain (ex. privacy) or were lacking terms that I considered essential. 

I thought I'd share this list I made of English cybersecurity terms with their French translation. It has around 345 entry-level terms from: IT, networking, access control, cryptography, attack techniques and procedures, information security, incident response, internet protocols, etc. I also provide a version where the terms are in French alphabetical order.

The .xls, .pdf and .ipynb files are available at https://github.com/celsol-fuentes/EN-FR_cyber_terms.

Feel free to fork this repository, add terms or even languages!
